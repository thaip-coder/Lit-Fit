# Literary FItness App
Project 2

1. The problem our app is trying to solve:
    - Our app aims to track the pages and books our user stores with us.

2. How is the app organized:
    - The app consists of a single index.html file that displays the UI
        - Various assets are joined with the index.html file to provide the user with an appealing display
            - CSS styling
            - Images
    - The app also consists of javascript files:
        1. index.js: this js facilitates the app's various functionalities.
        2. apiRoutes: this js handles the data we get, put, and post. 
        3. htmlRoutes: this js allows users to access the website and it's multiple pages (if we had more than one page).

3. How to run the app:
    1. Simply register a username and password, along with a book goal.
    2. Click the "Add Book" button to generate a row in the table.
    3. Input the book Title, Author, Pages Read, Total Pages, and Status of your book into their respective columns.
    4. Click Update to update the database with your book.
        - At any time, you may change the input fields to reflect your progress for any given book.
            - Hitting update will udpate the book progress to the database.
